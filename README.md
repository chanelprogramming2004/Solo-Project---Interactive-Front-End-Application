# Solo-Project---Interactive-Front-End-Application

iTunes Music Search

iTunes Music Search is a simple interactive web application that allows users to search for songs and artists using the iTunes Search API. Users can type an artist name, click search, and instantly see a grid of results with:

Album artwork
Song title
Artist name
Playable 30-second previews

This project demonstrates working with APIs, dynamic DOM updates, and responsive design. It’s a portfolio-ready solo project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technologies Used:

HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (ES6)
iTunes Search API (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The screenshot in the repository (Application screenshot.png) showcases the iTunes Music Search app in action. The user has searched for “Beyoncé,” and the app displays a responsive grid of song results, featuring album artwork, track names, artist names, and playable 30-second previews. Each result card is clearly separated, and the layout adapts seamlessly to both desktop and smaller screens.
