# Solo-Project---Interactive-Front-End-Application

Project name: iTunes Music Search

iTunes Music Search is a simple interactive web application that searches for songs and artists via the iTunes Search API. Users can type an artist name, click search, and instantly receive a grid of results containing: 
- Album artwork
- Song title
- Artist name
- Playable 30-second previews

This project teaches how to interact with APIs, dynamic DOM updates, and responsive design. It's a portfolio-ready solo project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- iTunes Search API (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html)

Features:
- Interactive search that fetches data from the iTunes API
- Displays song information in a responsive grid layout
- Playable audio previews for each track
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

The screenshot in the repository (Application screenshot.png) shows the iTunes Music Search app in action.  The user searches for "Beyoncé", and the app returns a responsive grid of song results that include album artwork, track names, artist names, and playable 30-second clips.  Each result card is cleanly divided, and the layout is responsive to both desktop and smaller displays.
